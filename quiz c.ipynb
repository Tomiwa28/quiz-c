Conventional systems achieve this balance through demand-driven electricity production. For future grids with a high share of inflexible (i.e., renewable) energy sources, the concept of demand response is a promising solution. This implies changes in electricity consumption in relation to electricity price changes. In this work, weâ€™ll build a binary classification model to predict if a grid is stable or unstable using the UCI Electrical Grid Stability Simulated dataset.\n","\n","Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Electrical+Grid+Stability+Simulated+Data+\n","\n","It has 12 primary predictive features and two dependent variables.\n","\n","Predictive features:\n","\n","'tau1' to 'tau4': the reaction time of each network participant, a real value within the range 0.5 to 10 ('tau1' corresponds to the supplier node, 'tau2' to 'tau4' to the consumer nodes);\n","'p1' to 'p4': nominal power produced (positive) or consumed (negative) by each network participant, a real value within the range -2.0 to -0.5 for consumers ('p2' to 'p4'). As the total power consumed equals the total power generated, p1 (supplier node) = - (p2 + p3 + p4);\n","'g1' to 'g4': price elasticity coefficient for each network participant, a real value within the range 0.05 to 1.00 ('g1' corresponds to the supplier node, 'g2' to 'g4' to the consumer nodes; 'g' stands for 'gamma');\n","Dependent variables:\n","\n","'stab': the maximum real part of the characteristic differential equation root (if positive, the system is linearly unstable; if negative, linearly stable);\n","'stabf': a categorical (binary) label ('stable' or 'unstable').\n","Because of the direct relationship between 'stab' and 'stabf' ('stabf' = 'stable' if 'stab' <= 0, 'unstable' otherwise), 'stab' should be dropped and 'stabf' will remain as the sole dependent variable (binary classification)."],"metadata":{"id":"KmpCc9K3siLo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### Importing Libaries"],"metadata":{"id":"8yboUgHAsvvX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importing
